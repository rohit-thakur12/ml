Hi, I am Rohit Thakur. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and I specialize in MLOps. I have managed entire projects alone and have implemented end-to-end solutions. 

My projects usually deal with natural language processing, information extraction and economic research.

I have experience building, deploying and monitoring ML models in highly regulated environment. 

I have built entire machine learning infrastructure from ground up for my organization and have lead several projects with tight deadlines. 

I have also delivered projects in under a week. 

Apart from machine learning, I have a background in econometrics and quantitative economics. I am currently exploring the uses of RL and causal inference in economic research.
