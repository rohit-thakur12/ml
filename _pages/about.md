Hi, I am Rohit Thakur. 

![MugShot](/images/mug1.png)

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and I specialize in MLOps.  

My projects usually deal with natural language processing, information extraction and economic research.

I have experience building, deploying and monitoring ML models in highly regulated environment. 

Apart from machine learning, I have a background in econometrics and quantitative economics. I am currently exploring the uses of RL and causal inference in economic research.
