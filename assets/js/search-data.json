            "title": "Differentiation and Integration with SymPy",
            "content": "Differentiation and Integration and the building blocks of calculus. They are usually taught in Calculus I. These two concept are heavily used in alot of fields, including machine learning. . If you don&#39;t remember, here is a high level introduction of what these two concepts are: . Differentiation (also called derivation) measures the rate of change of a function. Think of it like calculating slope in linear models. Only difference here is that you can calculate the slope at every point and for functions that are non linear. For Example: if f(x) = x**2 then, the derivative of this function is f&#39;(x) = 2x. The derivative function is read &quot;f prime of x&quot;. . Intergration on the other hand measures the area under the curve. For the above function, the integration or often called antiderivative will be x**3 / 3 . . Calculating Derivatives and Integrals is sometimes confusing so we&#39;ll use SymPy. We will start by installing the library. . !pip install sympy . Requirement already satisfied: sympy in c: users rohit miniconda3 envs math lib site-packages (1.8) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath&gt;=0.19 in c: users rohit miniconda3 envs math lib site-packages (from sympy) (1.2.1) . . Next we import everything we need. . from sympy import Symbol, diff, integrate . Since we will be calculating for x, we&#39;ll have to create a symbol for it. . x = Symbol(&#39;x&#39;) . Lets start by writing our function . f = 2*x**3+6 f . $ displaystyle 2 x^{3} + 6$ Now we calculate the derivative of the function using sympy. . f_prime = f.diff(x) f_prime . $ displaystyle 6 x^{2}$ So now we have the derivative of our function. Lets calculate the integral. . f_int = integrate(f_prime, x) f_int . $ displaystyle 2 x^{3}$ So this is how we calculate both the derivative and anti-derivative of a function using sympy. There are other libraries as well that work really well, e.g scipy. . . Important: These aren&#8217;t actual functions. In order to use these, you need to use &quot;lambdify&quot; them. We&#8217;ll start by importing it. . from sympy.utilities.lambdify import lambdify . f = lambdify(x, f) f_prime = lambdify(x, f_prime) f_int = lambdify(x, f_int) . print(f&quot;The value of function at 3 is: {f(3)} and its derivative is {f_prime(3)}&quot;) . The value of function at 3 is: 60 and its derivative is 54 .",

            "title": "Tracking Availability of Vaccination Slots using COWIN's API",
            "content": "Everyone wants to be vaccinated against covid-19. The only problem being not enough vaccination slots available. With the population being in billions and the daily vaccination doses being barely 50, it almost seems impossible to get a slot. . This is a guide on how to build an application that can automatically monitor COWIN for vaccination slots. . We will use COWIN’s api to first get all the centres in the specified pincode, extract the information required from that response, check for the availability of slots and send a message to our phone or an email letting us know if the slots are available. . Getting the data . Getting the data is easy as it has been open for everyone to use thourgh the government’s API Setu program. . We have options in how we wants to filter the data. For our app we will use the one that says “calenderByPin”. . Setting up twilio for SMS . Twilio is a service that allows us to send text messages for free to anyone and anywhere. We will use this to send a text message to our phone whenever a slot is available. . You can sign up for a free account and once your account is up and running, look for SID, Auth Token and your twilio phone number. You will find these on your dashboard. . Setting up an email notification service . Even though we send text messages in his app, you can create an email alert system if that suits you. . You can do this using “smtplib” which is a library in python that helps you send email alerts. . Building the application . First we start with importing the necessary libraries. . import requests import json from datetime import datetime from twilio.rest import Client . We use “requests” to send requests to the API. We are also using a json file to store all the configurations we need so we can change it whenever we want without breaking the app. Next we import “datetime” which is just so we can get the current date and last we import “twilio” which enables us to send messages. . NOTE: We have used json here but depending on the sensitivity of the data, you can either use environment variables or a “.ini” file and parse it using python’s “configparser”. . Setting up logging. . import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename=&quot;vaccine.log&quot;,format=&#39;%(asctime)s - %(message)s&#39;) . We set up logging to keep a check on our app. . Load the date and config file. . date = datetime.today().strftime(&#39;%d-%m-%Y&#39;) with open(&quot;config.json&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as file: data = json.load(file) . We load the date and the config file. The config file for now looks like this: . { &quot;pincode&quot;:[410501, 410505], &quot;age&quot;: 18, &quot;twilio-sid&quot;: &quot;##&quot;, &quot;twilio-auth&quot;: &quot;##&quot;, &quot;twilio-number&quot;: &quot;##&quot;, &quot;myNumber&quot;: &quot;##&quot; } . You can enter your details in the file. You can add or remove pincodes. Currently the only two age groups that can get vaccinated is people between 18-44 and people above 45 years of age. To get details about vaccination for people above the age of 45, change the “age” value to 45. . Parsing twilio credentials. . accountSid = data[&#39;twilio-sid&#39;] authToken = data[&#39;twilio-auth&#39;] client = Client(accountSid, authToken) myTwilioNumber = data[&#39;twilio-number&#39;] destCellPhone = data[&#39;myNumber&#39;] . We parse the information that we need to use twilio’s API. . Builing the funtion to monitor the API . def main(): for pincode in data[&#39;pincode&#39;]: _URL = f&quot;https://cdn-api.co-vin.in/api/v2/appointment/sessions/public/calendarByPin?pincode={pincode}&amp;date={date}&quot; response = requests.get(_URL) if response.status_code != 200: logging.info(f&quot;Error with code {response.status_code}&quot;) else: scrape = response.json() for i in scrape[&#39;centers&#39;]: sess = i[&#39;sessions&#39;] for sessions in sess: if sessions[&#39;available_capacity&#39;] &gt; 0 and sessions[&#39;min_age_limit&#39;] == data[&#39;age&#39;]: messageBody = f&quot;Vaccine available at {i[&#39;name&#39;]} - {i[&#39;address&#39;]} - {i[&#39;pincode&#39;]} on {sessions[&#39;date&#39;]} and the variant is {sessions[&#39;vaccine&#39;]}&quot; client.api.account.messages.create(to= destCellPhone, from_=myTwilioNumber, body=messageBody) else: logging.info(f&quot;Vaccine not available at {i[&#39;name&#39;]} - {i[&#39;pincode&#39;]}&quot;) . This is the whole function that is used to monitor the slots. We loop through all the pincodes in we want and look for availability. If the slots are available, we will get a text message. . Scheduling the script to run automatically. . Now that we have everything that we need, we can schedule the script to run automatically with the frequency we need. To do this, we can use Task Scheduler on Windows or CRON on linux/MAC. . Ending thoughts . Being a government website, it is unavailable ususally in the morning so dont worry if you get a 403 error. . Unfortunately we cannot schedule appointments directly using the API but you can contact the Ministry of Health if you plan on doing that like it says on the website. I hope this helps. .
